"""
AWS Credentials Manager - Pull temporary credentials for an IAM user.

Usage:
  AWS_PROFILE=usermanager iam-sorry <profile-to-manage>
  iam-sorry --profile usermanager <profile-to-manage>
  AWS_PROFILE=usermanager iam-sorry  (refreshes 'default' profile if it exists)

The script will:
1. If profile exists: Look up the IAM user associated with the access key and get temp creds for that user
2. If profile doesn't exist: Treat the profile name as an IAM username and get temp creds for that user
3. If no argument: Ask user to confirm refreshing the 'default' profile (if it exists and has valid user)
